## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Coming into the project, I had a beginner-level understanding of JavaScript,. so some of the challenges were initially difficult to work through. However, the detailed explanations and examples helped me grasp the syntax and better understand how to implement new functions. This experience has strengthened my confidence in writing JavaScript! However, I also experienced a lot of difficulty using the terminal/OS, which I overcame with the help of the linked resources and online resources I found.
